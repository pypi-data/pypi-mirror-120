# Audalign

Python package for aligning audio files using audio fingerprinting, cross-correlation, cross-correlation with spectrograms, or visual alignment techniques.

This package offers tools to align many recordings of the same event. This is primarily accomplished with fingerprinting, though where fingerprinting fails, correlation, correlation with spectrograms, and visual alignment techniques can be used to get a closer result. After an initial alignment is found, that alignment can be passed to "fine_align," which will find smaller, relative alignments to the main one.

Alignment consists of a dictionary containing alignment data for all files in a given directory. If an output directory is given, silence is placed before all files in the target directory so that all will automatically be aligned and writen to the output directory along with an audio file containing the sum of all audio.

All fingerprints are stored in memory and must be saved to disk with the save_fingerprinted_files method in order to persist them.

Regular file recogniton can also be done with Audalign similar to dejavu but held in memory.

"rankings" key is included in each alignment and recognition result. This helps determine the strength of the alignment but is not definitive proof. Values range from 1-10.

This package is primarirly focused on accuracy of alignments and has several accuracy settings. Parameters for visual alignment can be adjusted. Fingerprinting parameters can be generally set to get consistent results, but visual alignment requires case by case adjustment. Parameters for correlation are focused on sample rate or scipy's find_peaks.

[Noisereduce](https://timsainburg.com/noise-reduction-python.html) is very useful for this application and a wrapper is implemented for ease of use. Uniformly leveling prior to noise reduction using uniform_level_file boosts quiet but important sound features.

## Installation

Install from PyPI:

Don't forget to install ffmpeg/avlib (Below in the Readme)!

```bash
pip install audalign
```

OR

```bash
git clone https://github.com/benfmiller/audalign.git
cd audalign/
pip install audalign
```

OR

Download and extract audalign then

```bash
pip install audalign
```

in the directory

## Aligning

```python
import audalign
ada = audalign.Audalign()

print(ada.align("target/folder/", destination_path="write/alignments/to/folder"))
# or
print(ada.target_align(
    "target/files",
    "target/folder/",
    destination_path="write/alignments/to/folder",
    ))

# For Visual
print(ada.target_align(
    "target/files",
    "target/folder/",
    destination_path="write/alignments/to/folder",
    technique="visual",
    ))
# volume_threshold might need to be adjusted depending on the file

# For Correlation
print(ada.target_align(
    "target/files",
    "target/folder/",
    destination_path="write/alignments/to/folder",
    technique="correlation", # or "correlation_spectrogram"
    ))
```

Returns dictionary of each file recognized and best alignment. Also returns match info dictionary of each recognition in the folder

You can specify a destination folder to write the aligned files with the appropriate length of silence added to the front.

Target align only aligns with one target file rather than finding the file with the most and best matches.

## Fine Aligning

```python
import audalign
ada = audalign.Audalign()

rough_alignment = ada.align("target/folder/") # get rough alignment with regular aligning

fine_alignment = ada.fine_align( # get fine alignment with rough alignment
    rough_alignment,
    destination_path="write/alignments/to/folder"
    ) # defaults to correlation

# For Fingerprinting
print(ada.fine_align(
    rough_alignment,
    destination_path="write/alignments/to/folder",
    technique="fingerprints",
    ))
```

Fine aligning takes the output and alignment of regular alignments and finds alignments within the specified width.

This is very useful if there are multiple recordings with different relative offsets of the same event. Correlation is also more precice than fingerprints and does not fail to give an alignment.

## Fingerprinting

Audalign is mostly built on fingerprinting.

```python
import audalign
ada = audalign.Audalign()

ada.fingerprint_file("test_file.wav")

# or

ada.fingerprint_directory("audio/directory")
```

fingerprints are stored in ada and can be saved by

```python
ada.save_fingerprinted_files("save_file.json") # or .pickle
# or loaded with 
ada.load_fingerprinted_files("save_file.json") # or .pickle
```

All formats that ffmpeg or libav support are supported here.

## Recognizing

Alignments are accomplished with recognizing

```python
# Only returns matches with total fingerprint matches greater than 50 within 5 second windows
print(ada.recognize("matching_file.mp3", filter_matches=50, locality=5))

# For Visual
print(ada.visrecognize(
    target_file_path="target_file.mp3", against_file_path="against_file.mp3"
    ))

# For Correlation
print(ada.correcognize(
    target_file_path="target_file.mp3", against_file_path="against_file.mp3"
    ))

# For Correlation with spectrogram
print(ada.correcognize_spectrogram(
    target_file_path="target_file.mp3", against_file_path="against_file.mp3"
    ))
```

File doesn't have to be fingerprinted already. If it is, the file is not re-fingerprinted

Returns dictionary match time and match info. Match info is a dictionary of each file it recognized with. Each file is a dictionary of match information.

## Other Functions

```python
# wrapper for timsainb/noisereduce
ada.remove_noise_file(
    "target/file",
    "5", # noise start in seconds
    "20", # noise end in seconds
    "destination/file",
    alt_noise_filepath="different/sound/file",
    prop_decrease="0.5", # If you want noise half reduced
)

ada.remove_noise_directory(
    "target/directory/",
    "noise/file",
    "5", # noise start in seconds
    "20", # noise end in seconds
    "destination/directory",
    prop_decrease="0.5", # If you want noise half reduced
)

ada.uniform_level_file(
    "target/file",
    "destination",
    mode="normalize",
    width=5,
)

ada.plot("file.wav") # Plots spectrogram with peaks overlaid
ada.convert_audio_file("audio.wav", "audio.mp3") # Also convert video file to audio file
ada.get_metadata("file.wav") # Returns metadata from ffmpeg/ avlib
```

You can easily recalcute the alignment shifts from previous results using recalc_shifts.
You can then write those shifts using write_shifts_from_results. write_shifts_from_results also
lets you use different source files for alignments too.

```python
recalculated_results = ada.recalc_shifts(older_results)
ada.write_shifts_from_results(recalculated_results, "source_files_folder_or_file_list", "destination")
```

## Audalign Functions

```python
ada.set_multiprocessing(False) # If you want single threaded
ada.set_num_processors(4) # However many processors you have.
ada.set_accuracy(1) # from 1-4, sets fingerprinting variables for different levels of accuracy
ada.set_hash_style("base") #you can use "base" "base_three" "panako" "panako_mod"
ada.set_freq_threshold(100) # ignores frequencies below value. Max value is 2049. Not Hertz
```
