# Epic Server

EpicMan Server is a SANS-IO Async application server that runs your code over 
multiple 'Nodes'. This has the added effect of not being limited to a single 
core for running your code and mitigating some of the effects of the GIL in 
the cpython (and others) implementation

While this is an Async Server this is NOT AsyncIO compatible and brings its 
own abstractions for File, Network and locking in order to meet the latency 
requirements imposed by its primary use case (Game engine that runs atop this 
framework)

*** NOTE: this is a Technology preview/Alpha release ***

Only a single instance is likley to work at this time or 2 node clusters with 
caveats

Internal and External APIs are in heavy flux

## Features

* Pluggable IO engines
* Automatic Persistence of game features
* Transparent Inter-process messaging abstraction
* python3 codebase
* Uses async/await (but is not AsyncIO compatible)
* pypy3 compatible for versions supporting the python3.8 spec

## Getting Started

The Full documentation is available [here](http://docs.epic-man.com). The
examples below should give you a quick feel for management of a cluster and
what programming for epic server looks like.

### Requirements

* Python 3.6 or newer
* Linux 5.x or newer (io_uring)
  * liburing-dev (debian)
  * liburing1 (debian)
* 64bit CPU if using lmdb backend
* Kernel headers may be required to compile the python io_uring module

### Examples
Starting a single or multiple node cluster is relatively simple as shown below.
All that is required is a simple script to bootstrap the Initial Entities. In 
this example we use a simple test script called 'cluster.py' that is looked up
on PYTHONPATH. if using a script in your current directory then prepending 
PYTHONPATH=. to the epic-server commands will ensure that this script can be
found correctly.

    $ python3 -m venv venv
    $ venv/bin/pip install epicman-server
    $ venv/bin/epic-server -vvv -l '[::1]:3030'
    $ venv/bin/epic-server-start -vvv -b '[::1]:3030' cluster:start

## Programming for epicman.server
The following is taken from 'cluster:start' from the above example and simply
sends a value, has it incremented then passes the incremented value on to the 
next entity to confirm that the RPC like interface works

    from epicman.objects import EntityProxy, Entity, remote_spawn, remote_call
    from epicman.syscalls import THREAD_SLEEP
    from epicman.logging import log
    import sys

    TOTAL_COUNT = 1000

    class _Test(Entity):
        @remote_call
        async def test(self, val):
            return val + 1
    # this is a temporary work around pickle limitations and
    # issues pickle has with things that are renamed
    Test = EntityProxy(_Test)

    async def start():
        count = 0
        for i in range(TOTAL_COUNT):
            count = await Test[i].test(count)

        log.info('Value: {count}', count=count)
        sys.exit()
