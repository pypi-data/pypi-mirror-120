Implment an @stateless decorator

some grains may be stateless and not rely on grain state, these can be 
activated anywhere ont eh cluster and instanciated multiple times, indicate 
this with an @stateless method or class decroator so we can identify this state

Ideas:
implement a instance value of _epic_features so that the pool object can 
identify this feature and react ocordingly
