         ## Usage
         > Sample 1: Checks the dialect input against existing known phrases before decoding the sentence into a more standardized version of English language. A corrector is used to check and fix small grammatical errors.
        ```python
        # Sample 1
        import Caribe as cb
        from Caribe import trinidad_decode, trinidad_decode_split, caribe_corrector
        
        sentence = "Ah wah mi modda phone"
        standard = cb.phrase_decode(sentence)
        standard = cb.trinidad_decode(standard)
        fixed = cb.caribe_corrector(standard)
        print(fixed) #Output: I want my mother phone
        
        ```
        >Sample 2: Checks the dialect input against existing known phrases
        ```python
        # Sample 2 
        import Caribe as cb
        from Caribe import trinidad_decode, trinidad_decode_split, caribe_corrector
        
        sentence = "Waz de scene"
        standard = cb.phrase_decode(sentence)
        
        print(standard) # Outputs: How are you
        
        ```
        >Sample 3: Checks the sentence for any grammatical errors or incomplete words and corrects it.
        ```python
        #Sample 3
        import Caribe as cb
        from Caribe import trinidad_decode, trinidad_decode_split, caribe_corrector
        
        sentence = "I am playin fotball outsde"
        standard = cb.caribe_corrector(sentence)
        
        print(standard) # Outputs: I am playing football outside
        
        ```
