# pypbt

This library implements functions to write _property based tests_ in
python.

It started as a proof of concept. By now there are still some missing
features:

  - Shrinking
  
  - Generation strategies
  
  - State machines
  
We can not make any promises about them.


## Installation

pip install pypbt
```
