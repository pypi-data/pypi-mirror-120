# SupCL-Seq :book:
Supervised Contrastive Learning for Downstream Optimized Sequence representations (**SupCS-Seq**) extends the supervised contrastive learning from computer vision to the optimization of sequence representations in NLP. By altering the dropout mask probability in standard Transformer architectures (e.g. *BERT_base*), for every representation (anchor), we generate augmented altered views. A supervised contrastive loss is then utilized to maximize the systemâ€™s capability of pulling together similar samples (e.g. anchors and their altered views) and pushing apart the samples belonging to the other classes. Despite its simplicity, SupCL-Seq leads to large gains in many sequence classification tasks on the GLUE benchmark compared to a standard *BERT_base*, including 6% absolute improvement on CoLA, 5.4% on MRPC, 4.7% on RTE and 2.6% on STS-B.

This package can be easily run on almost all of the transformer models in [`Huggingface`](https://huggingface.co/) :hugs: that contain an encoder including but not limited to:

1. [ALBERT](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/albert.html)
2. [BERT](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/bert.html)
3. [BigBird](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/bigbird.html)
4. [RoBerta](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/roberta.html)
5. And many more!


## Installation
Simply follow:

```bash
$ pip install SupCL-Seq
```

## Usage
The package builds on the [`trainer`](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/trainer.html) from [`Huggingface`](https://huggingface.co/):hugs:. Therefore, its use is exactly similar to [`trainer`](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/trainer.html).

```python
from SupCL_Seq import SupCsTrainer

SupCL_trainer = SupCsTrainer.SupCsTrainer(
            w_drop_out=[0.0,0.05,0.2],      # Number of views and their associated mask drop-out probabilities [Optional]
            temperature= 0.05,              # Temeprature for the contrastive loss function [Optional]
            def_drop_out=0.1,               # Default drop out of the transformer, this is usually 0.1 [Optional]
            pooling_strategy='mean',        # Strategy used to extract embeddings can be from `mean` or `pooling` [Optional]
            model = model,                  # model
            args = CL_args,                 # Arguments from `TrainingArguments` [Optional]
            train_dataset=train_dataset,    # Train dataloader
            tokenizer=tokenizer,            # Tokenizer
            compute_metrics=compute_metrics # If you need a customized evaluation [Optional]
        )

```
