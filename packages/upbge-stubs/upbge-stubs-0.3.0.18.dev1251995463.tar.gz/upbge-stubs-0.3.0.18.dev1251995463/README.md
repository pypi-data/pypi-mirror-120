Blender / UPBGE API Stubs
=========================

This module provides type information for [Blender](https://www.blender.org) and 
[UPBGE](https://upbge.org)'s Python API, following the 
[PEP-561](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0561/) standard.

It was generated using [BPY Stub Generator](https://github.com/mysticfall/bpystubgen) which 
is also available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/bpystubgen) as a separate module.

## Installation ##

There are two variants of the API stubs, one for Blender and the other for UPBGE. For Blender, 
you can install `blender-stubs` module with appropriate version qualifier as follows: 

```bash
$ pip install blender-stubs==2.93.*
```
This will install the latest module for Blender 2.93, and for now stubs are provided for Blender 
2.80 and onwards. You can also specify the next unreleased version as `3.0.*` to get the latest 
snapshot of the module.

As for UPBGE, stubs are available for the upcoming 0.3 release, which you can install as follows:

```bash
$ pip install upbge-stubs==0.3.*
```
