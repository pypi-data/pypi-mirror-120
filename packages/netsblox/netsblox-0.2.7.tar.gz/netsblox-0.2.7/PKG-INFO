Description: # NetsBlox-python
        
        NetsBlox-python is a wrapper for accessing [NetsBlox](https://netsblox.org/) services from within python.
        You can import this package in any python program that has internet access and begin calling RPCs and sending/receiving messages.
        
        # Installation
        
        NetsBlox-python is available as a pip package called `netsblox`, so you can install it with the following:
        
        ```sh
        pip install netsblox
        ```
        
        Keep in mind that NetsBlox-python is a python3 package, so you may need to use `pip3` if your `pip` still points to the python2 version.
        
        # Example Usage
        
        Here's a short example to see how you can access the [`MaunaLoaCO2Data`](https://editor.netsblox.org/docs/services/MaunaLoaCO2Data/index.html) service from python.
        
        ```py
        import netsblox
        
        client = netsblox.Client() # create a client to access NetsBlox
        co2 = client.get_service('MaunaLoaCO2Data')
        data = co2.get_co2_trend(2000, 2010)
        print(data)
        ```
        
        # Naming Conventions
        
        As seen in the example above, services are referenced by name as a string.
        These are identical to the service names shown in the [NetsBlox services documentation](https://editor.netsblox.org/docs/index.html).
        The RPCs (functions) in each service, however, are methods on the service object.
        NetsBlox uses `cammelCase` names, while python uses `snake_case`.
        If you see a function in the NetsBlox documentation like `performSomeAction`, you just need to write the equivalent snake case name `perform_some_action`.
