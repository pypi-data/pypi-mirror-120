# Simple Flask CMS

Simple flask CMS aims to be a very simple and flexible CMS system, suitable for a wide range of uses. The modular design
allows you to use or not use various parts depending on use.

Right now, the plugin is still in development, however, it aims to support the following features:

Currently, working features

* Simple page editor using SimpleMarkdownEditor
* Ability to upload and manage images
* Automatically generate navigation menus
* Support for SQL
* Authentication

Currently, WIP features:

* Headless mode
* Support for MongoDB
* More content types: Fragments and posts

Now it uses SQL and mongoDB support was temporarily dropped, though it will be added again soon.

## Installing

Install via pip:

```bash
pip install simple_flask_cms
```

And use in your application:

```python
from simple_flask_cms import cms

app.register_blueprint(cms.cms)
```

You can set some settings:

```python
import simple_flask_cms.database_providers.sql_database

simple_flask_cms.db_connection = simple_flask_cms.database_providers.sql_database.SQLDatabaseProvider(
    app)  # The database to use
# You can get a free mongoDB database from atlas, or use your own database. SQL support coming soon.
simple_flask_cms.template_name = 'page.html'  # The template to use for CMS pages, later section explains in more detail.
simple_flask_cms.upload_folder = 'media/images'  # Where to place uploaded images
simple_flask_cms.authentication_function = simple_flask_cms.noop_authentication_function  # Used to authenticate requests
```

Simple-Flask-CMS will attempt to connect to the database before the first request.

## Creating a page template

If you want to use Simple-Flask-CMS for pages, you need to provide a page template. An example of a template would look
like this:

```jinja
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>{{ page.title }}
</head>
<body>
<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<article>
     {{ page.html }}
</article>
<nav>
    {% include 'recursive_nav.html' %}
</nav>
```

The file `recursive_nav.html`:

```jinja
<ul>
    {% for page in nav %}
        <li><a href="{{ url_for("cms.page", path=page.url) }}">{{ page.nav_title }}</a></li>
        {% if page.subpages %}
            {% with nav=page.subpages %}
                {% include 'recursive_nav.html' %}
            {% endwith %}
        {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
```

In the aim for minimalism, Simple Flask CMS gives you full controll over the styling of your pages. However, if you want
a preset look take a look at the example in the repository.

## Creating your first page

To create a page, navigate to `/cms/editor/[your new page path]`. Enter your settings for the page here. The page will
be shown under `/cms/[page path]`. In the navigation `/cms/bugs/ladybuy` will appear under `/cms/bug`.

### Title

Typically displayed at the top of the page, though you can customize this in your template.

### Navigation title

Typically shown in the nav bar and in links to the page. Defaults to be the same as the title.

### Page content

The page content is markdown, using the [python-markdown](python-markdown.github.io) package. By default the code blocks
and highlight extension are enabled.

### Sort order

The order that the page will be shown in under navigation. Defaults to the number of pages. 0 means auto.

## Adding Authentication

By default, anybody can create or delete pages. Typically, this is not what you want. Flask-Simple-CMS does not include
it's own authentication function, but rather you can supply your own.

The typical way is to assign a function to `cms.authentication_function`. This function should return `None` if the
request is authorized. If it returns anything else, the returned value will be sent as a response back to the client
instead of the action. An example of a authentication function using only basic auth is:

```python
def authentication_function(action, parameters):
    auth = flask.request.authorization
    if auth and auth.username == config["username"] and auth["password"] == config["password"]:
        return None
    else:
        return flask.Response(
            status=401,
            headers={'WWW-Authenticate': 'Basic realm="FlaskCMS"'}
        )
```

Then set it like:
```python
cms.authentication_function = authentication_function
```

In this case, `action` is the name of the endpoint, and parameters are the path parameters.
