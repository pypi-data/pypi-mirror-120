version 3.0.1
    1) Use "setuptools" instead of the old "distutils" tools.
    2) Updated the "README" file - to use Python 3.4

version 3.0 --- Started using Python 3
	date 01 July 2014
	1) Converted tp Python 3.4 and the use of the ttk themed wigets.
	2) Cleaned up some of the code. No longer use an UooerCase file.

		evaluation of the sepc. file text.

		as the global dictionary.

version 1.0.1
	date 04 May 2014
	1) Added "__builtins__:None" entry to the self.GlobalDict in file netana.py.
		this was added to make using Python commands "exec" and "eval" safer to

		"spec" file or equation entery methods.
