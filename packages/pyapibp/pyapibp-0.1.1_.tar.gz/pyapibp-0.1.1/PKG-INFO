        This python script generates a folder structure along all default files for an API framework in the current directory, optionally creating a new one.
        
        Currently supported frameworks:
        
        - Flask
        - FastAPI
        
        Work in progress:
        
        - Django
        
        ## Short backstory
        
        When getting started on building an API, I found myself looking up an older project, copying the folder structure along the files and their contents. Then, remembering what environment variables I should include in the .env and their defaults for a local project. All in all, it was repetitive and annoying. Then let's be honest, why spend 5 minutes doing a repetitive task every now and then if you can spend 3 hours trying to automate it. Anyway, I hope you find this tool useful, and if you did, leave a star just so I know you found this tool useful.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Installation is done using pip using the following command:
        
            pip install pyapibp
        
        ## Usage
        
        In the desired folder, run the following command:
        
            $ pyapibp
        
        That's about it, follow the instructions, choose your options and tada, you are ready to code!
        
        I will write a more detailed description of the options after adding more frameworks, flags *etc... etc...*, but for now, enjoy.
