    Discord utilizes Twitter's snowflake format for uniquely
    identifiable descriptors (IDs).

    These IDs are guaranteed to be unique across all of Discord,
    except in some unique scenarios in which child objects
    share their parent's ID.

    Because Snowflake IDs are up to 64 bits in size (e.g. a uint64),
    they are always returned as strings in the HTTP API
    to prevent integer overflows in some languages.
