    'long_description': '# Welcome to the PyClinic\n\nPyClinic is a library to make it easier and faster to get your Service Testing up and running!\n\nPyClinic currently supports and auto-generates functions for:\n\n- Postman Collections\n- Swagger2 Spec Files\n- OpenAPI3 Spec Files\n\n> 💡 This allows you to quickly write automation to work with many endpoints or even write automated tests against those endpoints!\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Quickstart](#quickstart)\n- [OpenApi3 Demo (Swagger 2 is identical)](#openapi3-demo-notebook)\n- [In-Depth Postman Example](#in-depth-postman-example)\n- [Automated Test Example](#automated-test-example)\n- [Working with Postman Variables](#working-with-postman-variables)\n- [Setup and Contribute](#setup-and-contribute)\n\n---\n\n## Quickstart\n\n1. Export your Collection from Postman (as `example.postman_collection.json`, for example)\n\n2. Install PyClinic with your preferred Package Manager\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pyclinic\n   ```\n\n3. Make an instance of `Postman` and pass in the file path to your JSON file.\n\n   > 💡 You will see the instance commonly referred to as `runner`\n\n   ```python\n   from pyclinic.postman import Postman\n\n   runner = Postman("example.postman_collection.json")\n   ```\n\n4. Then call the endpoint function and do something with the response!\n\n   ```python\n   response = runner.Pets.list_all_pets()\n   assert response.ok\n   print(response.json())\n   ```\n\n5. The process is the same for a Swagger2 or OpenApi3 Spec File, but you use the `Swagger` or `OpenApi` class instead\n\n   ```python\n   from pyclinic.openapi import OpenApi\n\n   runner = OpenApi("path-to-spec-file.yml")\n   response = runner.Pets.list_all_pets()\n   assert response.ok\n   print(response.json())\n   ```\n\n---\n\n## OpenApi3 Demo Notebook (Swagger2 experience is identical)\n\n> Open our [demo_openapi3_runner.ipynb](./demo_openapi3_runner.ipynb) for a Jupyter Notebook experience of how to use PyClinic.\n\n## In-Depth Postman Example\n\n> Open our [demo_postman_runner.ipynb](./demo_postman_runner.ipynb) for a Jupyter Notebook experience of how to use PyClinic.\n\nWhen you instantiate `Postman()`, it converts the Postman Collection JSON and turns each request into an executable function.\n\nTake this [Deck of Cards API Collection](https://github.com/ElSnoMan/pyclinic/blob/main/tests/examples/deckofcards.postman_collection.json) example. Here is what the folder structure looks like in Postman:\n\n- Root\n  - ↪️ Create shuffled deck\n  - 📂 Folder 1\n    - ↪ Reshuffle Deck\n    - 📂 Folder 1.1\n      - ↪️ Draw Cards\n  - 📂 Folder 2\n    - ↪️ List Cards in Piles\n\n1. Make an instance of Postman\n\n   ```python\n   from pyclinic.postman import Postman\n\n   runner = Postman("deckofcards.postman_collection.json")\n   ```\n\n2. To call the `Create shuffle deck` function at the Collection Root, you would use\n\n   ```python\n   response = runner.Root.create_shuffled_deck()\n   ```\n\n3. Then do what you need with the Response!\n\n   > 💡 pyclinic uses the `requests` library to make requests and to work with responses!\n\n   ```python\n   assert response.ok\n   print(response.json())\n\n   """ Output:\n   {\n       "success": true,\n       "deck_id": "3p40paa87x90",\n       "shuffled": true,\n       "remaining": 52\n   }\n   """\n   ```\n\n4. If you want to call the `Draw Cards` item under `Folder 1 > Folder 1.1`, then use:\n\n   ```python\n   response = runner.Folder11.draw_cards()\n   ```\n\n   > 💡 All folders in the Postman Collection are flattened, so you don\'t have to do `runner.Folder1.Folder11.draw_cards()`\n\n5. You can see all folders and functions that can be used with the `show_folders` function\n\n   ```python\n   runner.show_folders()\n   ```\n\n   ```python\n   # or use .help() to see which functions belong to a folder\n   runner.Folder1.help()\n   ```\n\n### Folder Names and Function Names are normalized\n\nObserve how, in the last example with `runner.Folder11.draw_cards()`, each Postman item name is turned into Pythonic syntax:\n\n- Folders are turned into classes, so `Folder 1` turns into `Folder1`\n- Requests are turned into functions, so `Draw Cards` turns into `draw_cards`\n\n---\n\n## Automated Test Example\n\n```python\ndef test_deckofcards_multiple_calls():\n    runner = Postman("deckofcards.postman_collection.json")\n\n    create_response = runner.Root.create_shuffled_deck()\n    deck_id = create_response.json().get("deck_id")\n\n    response = runner.Folder11.draw_cards({"deck_id": deck_id})\n    assert response.ok\n    assert len(response.json()["cards"]) == 2, "Should draw two cards from deck"\n```\n\n## Working with Postman Variables\n\nPostman has 3 layers of Variables, but we\'ve added a 4th:\n\n1. Global\n2. Environment\n3. Collection\n4. User\n\n`Collection Variables` come as part of your collection when you export it. However, `Global` and `Environment` variables must be exported separately.\n\nWhen instantiating a Postman runner, you can pass in the paths to these exported Variables files to include them.\n\n```python\ndef test_runner_show_variables():\n   user_variables = {"USERNAME": "Carlos Kidman", "SHOW": "ME THE MONEY"}\n   runner = Postman(COLLECTION_PATH, ENV_PATH, GLOBAL_PATH, user_variables)\n   runner.show_variables()\n\n   """ Output:\n   {\n    \'NAME\': {\'value\': \'CARLOS KIDMAN\', \'enabled\': True},\n    \'BASE_URL\': {\'value\': \'https://demoqa.com\', \'enabled\': True},\n    \'USER_ID\': {\'value\': \'\', \'enabled\': True},\n    \'USERNAME\': {\'value\': \'Carlos Kidman\', \'enabled\': True},\n    \'PASSWORD\': {\'value\': \'\', \'enabled\': True},\n    \'TOKEN\': {\'value\': \'\', \'enabled\': True},\n    \'SHOW\': {\'value\': \'ME THE MONEY\', \'enabled\': True}\n   }\n   """\n```\n\n> NOTE: User Variables are defined as a flat dictionary with the key-value pairs you want. These will override values if they already exist, or add them if they don\'t.\n\nYou can use the `.show_variables()` method to display the variables that the Postman runner has been instantiated with.\n\nFinally, you can use the `.help()` method on the executable function to see the raw request dictionary that is being used. This is extremely helpful when needing more details about the request function you\'re dealing with.\n\n```python\nrunner = Postman("bookstore.postman_collection.json")\nrunner.Account.create_user.help()\n\n""" Output:\n{\n    \'method\': \'POST\',\n    \'url\': \'https://demoqa.com/Account/v1/User\',\n    \'data\': {\'userName\': \'{{$randomFullName}}\', \'password\': \'P@$$w0rd\'},\n    \'headers\': {}\n}\n"""\n```\n\n## TIPS\n\nInstantiate the Postman runner at the top of the file and use the show methods to display info. This way you can see the folders and the variables that you have at the beginning of the program or test run:\n\n```python\nfrom pyclinic.postman import Postman\n\n\nrunner = Postman(BOOKSTORE_PATH, BOOKSTORE_ENV_VARIABLES_PATH)\nrunner.show_folders()\nrunner.show_variables()\n\ndef create_user(credentials: Dict) -> Dict:\n    response = runner.Account.create_user(data=credentials)\n    return response.json()\n\n...\n```\n\n---\n\n## Setup and Contribute\n\n💡 Use `Poetry` as the package manager to take advantage of the `pyproject.toml` at the Workspace Root\n\n> ⚠️ Python version 3.7 or higher is required\n\n1. Clone/Fork this repo and open it in your favorite editor (VS Code, Pycharm, etc)\n\n2. Open the Integrated Terminal and use Poetry to install all dependencies\n\n   ```bash\n   # this also creates the virtual environment automatically\n   poetry install\n   ```\n\n3. Configure your IDE\n\n   - Select Interpreter - Gives you autocomplete, intellisense, etc\n   - Configure Tests - We use `pytest` instead of the default `unittest` library\n   - Any other settings. This project uses a Formatter (`black`) and Linter (`flake8`)\n\n4. That\'s it! Run the tests to see it all work\n\n   ```bash\n   poetry run poe test\n   ```\n\n5. Make your changes, then submit a Pull Request (PR) for review. This automatically triggers a pipeline that lints and runs tests. Once the pipeline is green, a **Maintainer** will review your PR! 😄\n\n---\n\n### Twitch Shoutouts 💪🏽🐍\n\nI have been building this entirely while streaming on Twitch!\nCome check it out every weekday at 12:00pm MST at https://twitch.tv/carloskidman\n\n- **_`@sudomaze`_** - amazing feedback, humor, and searching skills\n- **_`@vernkofford`_** - OG subscriber and friend\n',
