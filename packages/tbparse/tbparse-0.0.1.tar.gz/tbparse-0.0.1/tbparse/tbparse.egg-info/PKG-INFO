Read, parse, and plot tensorboard event logs with ease!

tbparse is a simple parser for reading tensorboard logs. It supports logs generated by [TensorFlow / Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensorboard.html), and [TensorboardX](https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboardX).

Currently, tbparse enables parsing native types (scalars, tensors, histograms, etc.) easily. More event types will be supported in future versions.
