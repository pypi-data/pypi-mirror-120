        ## Caveats
        
        ### About SemanticScholar API
        
        We are using [SemanticScholar API](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api) to get the paper metadata. The API has some rate limits ([100 requests per 5 minutes](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api)).
        
        A possible workaround for large number of papers is to split them into batches.
        
        Todo:
        - [ ] Use API keys from SemanticScholar.
