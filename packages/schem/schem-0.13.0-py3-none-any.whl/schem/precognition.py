    """Given a Solution, run/validate it then check if fits the current community definition of a precognitive solution.

    If time constraints do not allow enough runs for 99.99% certainty either way, raise a TimeoutError.

    Currently, a solution is considered precognitive if:
    * It fails for >= 75% of random seeds
    * OR it assumes the value of the Nth molecule of a random input, for some N >= 2.
      Stated conversely, a solution (with acceptable success rate) is non-precognitive if, for each random input I,
      each N >= 2, and each type of molecule M that I may create, there exists a random seed where the Nth input of I is
      M, and the solution succeeds.

    In practice we check this with the following process:
    1. Run the solution on the original level, verifying it succeeds (validate the solution's expected score here too if
       possible). Track how many molecules were generated from each random input (call this N), and what the nth
       molecule's variant was for every n up to N.
    2. Increment the seeds of all random inputs at once until a set of seeds is found that has the same first molecule
       produced for each input (since assumptions on the first input are allowed). Incrementing the seeds in lockstep
       also ensures assumptions about inputs that share a seed are not violated (such assumptions are not forbidden in
       non-precognitive solutions).
    3. Repeat step 1 with the new random seed(s) (but without requiring that it succeed). Update N for each random input
       to be whichever run used less molecules (since the solution might always terminate on a certain molecule, using
       the max would risk the last n never being able to 'find' all variants).
       If the solution succeeds, aggregrate the nth-input-variant data with that of the first run, in order to track
       which variants for a given n have had at least one run succeed.
       If the solution fails, put the same nth-input-variant data in a separate 'failure variants' dataset.
    4. Repeat steps 2-3 until any of the following conditions is met:
       * The failure rate is measured to be >= 75%, with sufficient confidence (precog).
       * The success rate is measured to be > 25% with sufficient confidence, and the dataset of succeeding runs covers
         every possible variant of every possible n (2 <= n <= N), for all random input components (non-precog).
       * The maximum allowed runs based on max_total_cycles is reached (TimeoutError).
         With default settings this should only occur for very long (10k+ cycles) solutions or solutions with a
         failure rate extremely close to 75%.

    Args:
        solution: The loaded solution to check.
        max_cycles: The maximum cycle count allowed for a SINGLE run of the solution (passed to Solution.run).
            Note that this is not the total number of cycles allowed across all runs; any solution within this limit
            is allowed to run at least twice, with the maximum runs taken being limited for extremely slow solutions.
            This is bounded to 300 runs, since at a certain point it can be assumed that the missing variants are not
            being found because the first molecule was unique in its bucket.
        max_total_cycles: The maximum total cycle count that may be used by all runs; if this value is exceeded before
            sufficient confidence in an answer is obtained, a TimeoutError is raised.
        just_run_cycle_count: In order to save on excess runs, if the solution has just been successfully run on the
            loaded level (and not been modified or reset() since), pass its cycle count here to skip the first run (but
            still pull the first run's data from the Solution object).
        verbose: If True, print more detailed info on the number of runs performed and how many passed before returning.
        stderr_on_precog: If True, when a solution is precognitive, print an explanation of why to STDERR.
                          Can be enabled independently of `verbose`. Default False.
