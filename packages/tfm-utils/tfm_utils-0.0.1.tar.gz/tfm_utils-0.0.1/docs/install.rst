Installation
=============

TFM_utils is on PyPI, so you can install via ``pip`` easily::

    pip install tfm_utils


or locally with::

    git clone repo_name_here
    cd tfm_utils
    CC=clang CXX=clang++ python -m pip install e .


You need to use the weird install function to get the C++ code to work
