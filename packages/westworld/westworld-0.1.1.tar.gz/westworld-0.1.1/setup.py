Its inspiration is drawn from Unity software and [Unity ML Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents), adapted in Python. \n\nThe goal is to be able to simulate environments in logistics, retail, epidemiology, providing pre-coded spatial environments and communication between agents. Optimization can be included using heuristics as well as Reinforcement Learning.\n\n!!! warning "Experimental"\n    This library is extremely experimental, under active development and alpha-release\n    Don\'t expect the documentation to be up-to-date or all features to be tested\n    Please contact [us](mailto:theo.alves.da.costa@gmail.com) if you have any question\n\n*The name is of course inspired by the TV series Westworld, which is actually a gigantic multi-agent simulation system.*\n\n## Documentation\nDocumentation is available locally in docs folder or online at https://theolvs.github.io/westworld\n\n## Features\n### Current features\n- Easy creation of Grid and non-grid environments\n- Objects (Agents, Obstacles, Collectibles, Triggers)\n- Subclassing of different objects to create custom objects\n- Spawner to generate objects randomly in the environment\n- Basic rigid body system for all objects\n- Simple agent behaviors (pathfinding, wandering, random walk, fleeing, vision range)\n- Automatic maze generation\n- Layer integration to convert image to obstacle and snap it to a grid\n- Sample simulations and sample agents for classic simulations\n- Simulation visualization, replay and export (gif or video)\n\n### Roadmap features\n- More classic simulations and tutorials (boids, sugarscape)\n- Better pathfinding\n- Easy Reinforcement Learning integration with Stable Baselines\n- Other visualization functions than PyGame for web integration \n\n\n## Installation\n### Install from PyPi\nThe library is available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/westworld/) via \n```\npip install westworld\n```\n\n### For developers\n- You can clone the github repo / fork and develop locally\n- Poetry is used for environment management, dependencies and publishing, after clone you can run \n\n```\n# To setup the environment\npoetry install\n\n# To run Jupyter notebook or a python console\npoetry run jupyter notebook\npoetry run python\n```\n\n## Contributors\n- [ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa](mailto:theo.alves.da.costa@gmail.com)\n\n## Javascript version\nA javascript version is being developed at https://github.com/TheoLvs/westworldjs\n\n',
