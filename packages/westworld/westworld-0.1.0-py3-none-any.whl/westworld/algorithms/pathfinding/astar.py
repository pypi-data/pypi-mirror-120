"""A* pathfinding algorithm implementation
Closely adapted from the work of : 
- Nicholas Swift https://medium.com/@nicholas.w.swift/easy-a-star-pathfinding-7e6689c7f7b2
- Ryan Collinwood https://gist.github.com/ryancollingwood/32446307e976a11a1185a5394d6657bc (improvement on the latter example)

        TODO - This can probably be a lot accelerated by numba and or cython
        TODO - Requires for westworld env to have a get_nav_mesh() method extracting numpy array
        TODO - Will only work if grid environment, yet possible to discretize env if needed
        TODO - Add stop at n iterations to fasten computation
