Translating doconce text in solutions.do.txt to pdflatex
*** error: found 1 tex block markers for 0 initial tex blocks
Abort!
    Possible causes:
           - mismatch of !bc and !ec within one file, such that a !bc
             swallows tex blocks
           - mismatch of !bc and !ec across files in multi-file documents
           - !bt and !et inside code blocks - replace by |bt and |et
    (run doconce on each file to locate the problem, then on
     smaller and smaller parts of each file)
