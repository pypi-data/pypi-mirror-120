```shell
pip install request-boost
```

**Important:** *Virtual Environment is recommended*

## Usage

```python
# Sample data
number_of_sample_urls = 1000
urls = [ f'https://postman-echo.com/get?random_data={test_no}' for test_no in range(number_of_sample_urls) ]
headers = [{'sample_header':test_no} for test_no in range(number_of_sample_urls)]
```

```python
from request_boost import boosted_requests

results = boosted_requests(urls=urls)
print(results)
```

```python
from request_boost import boosted_requests

results = boosted_requests(urls=urls, no_workers=16, max_tries=5, timeout=5, headers=headers)
print(results)
```

## Documentation

```
boosted_requests(urls, no_workers=8, max_tries=3, timeout=10, headers=None)

Get data from APIs in parallel by creating workers that process in the background
    :param urls: list of URLS
    :param no_workers: maximum number of parallel processes
    :param max_tries: Maximum number of tries before failing for a specific URL
    :param timeout: Waiting time per request
    :param headers: Headers if any for the URL requests
    :return: List of response for each API (order is maintained)
```
