Description: Data Scraper is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from any url. You don't have to inspect any web elements to find tags, xpath id etc.
        It learns from the links of the web pages given by you & builds a scraper. Then you can use it to get JSON data out of other pages.
        
        ### Train Scraper
        Training the scraper requires urls of 2 pages as input.
        These pages should look similar but contain different data.
        Then it finds the pattern in the 2 pages & returns scraper id.
        This id can be used to fetch JSON data out of the other similar pages.
        Training may take 2-3 minutes but once trained ,then scraper runs fast
        ```sh
        from data_scraper import *
        link1='https://pypi.org/search/?q=request'
        link2='https://pypi.org/search/?q=datakund'
        response=scraper.train(link1,link2)
        print(response)
        #{'id':'QJP4LW2EBTQM45N',success:true}
        open('PyPi Scraper.txt', 'w').write(response['id'])
        ```
        
        
        ### Run Scraper
        Running the scraper requires 2 inputs .
        First is the url which you want to scrape data from
        Second is the 'id' of the scraper which was given in response of training
        ```sh
        from data_scraper import *
        Id=open('PyPi Scraper.txt', 'r').read()
        #This is id of scraper we got in training above
        link3='https://pypi.org/search/?q=scraper'
        response=scraper.run(link3,id=Id)
        with open('./data.json','w') as data:
        	data.write(json.dumps(response,indent=4))
        ```
