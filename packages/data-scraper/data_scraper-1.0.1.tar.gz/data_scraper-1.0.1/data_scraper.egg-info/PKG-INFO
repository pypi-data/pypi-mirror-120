        ![Data Scraper Explanation](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/datakund-studio.appspot.com/o/Pypi%20data%20scraper.png?alt=media&token=e1e961db-6694-4823-82f6-b7fb41139075)
        
        ### Train Scraper
        * Training the scraper requires urls of 2 pages as input.
        * These pages should look similar but contain different data.
        * Then it finds the pattern in the 2 pages & returns scraper id.
        * This id can be used to fetch JSON data out of the other similar pages.
        * Training may take 2-3 minutes but once trained ,then scraper runs fast
        
        **link1:-** link from where you want to scrape data
        **link2:-** similiar link to link1 (explained below)
        **response:-** returns id and status, id will be used for runing scraper
        ```sh
        from data_scraper import *
        link1='https://pypi.org/search/?q=request'
        link2='https://pypi.org/search/?q=datakund'
        response=scraper.train(link1,link2)
        print(response)
        #{'id':'QJP4LW2EBTQM45N',success:true}
        open('PyPi Scraper.txt', 'w').write(response['id'])
        ```
        
        
        ### Run Scraper
        Running the scraper requires 2 inputs .
        First is the url which you want to scrape data from
        Second is the 'id' of the scraper which was given in response of training
        **Id:-** Id of the scraper fetched during training
        **link3:-** specify link from where you want to extract data
        **response:-** structured json data 
        **Output Example:-** 
        {
          "Search Results": [
            {
              "title": "datakund-scraper",
              "description": "Web scraper library"
            },
            {}
          ],
          "Other_Pages_Results": [
            {
              "page": 2,
              "page_link": "/page=2"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```sh
        from data_scraper import *
        Id=open('PyPi Scraper.txt', 'r').read()
        #This is id of scraper we got in training above
        link3='https://pypi.org/search/?q=scraper'
        response=scraper.run(link3,id=Id)
        with open('./data.json','w') as data:
        	data.write(json.dumps(response,indent=4))
        ```
        
        ### How it works?
        * It takes two similiar links to train the scraper.
        * Then in backend algorithms are applied on them to save the data structure for those kind of pages.
        * It learns from the links of the web pages given by you and builds a scraper.
        * In the response you get ID of the scraper.
        * That id can be used to run the scraper for the links simililiar to the above training links.
        
        ### How to train scraper?
        For the training, we need two similiar links. 
        Two similiar links means where data is different but the structure of page is same.
        * **First Link:-** Link from where you want to scrape data.
        * **Second Link:-** Similiar link to above, like next pages link, different search results
        
        Let us see from examples, to understand second link.
        * **Pypi search results:-** search results for different keywords, other pages links(page=1,page=2,...)
        For example:-https://pypi.org/search/?q=firebase, https://pypi.org/search/?q=sql
        https://pypi.org/search/?o=&q=datakund&page=2, https://pypi.org/search/?o=&q=datakund&page=3
        * **Coin market cap of Bitcoin:-** another currency page(Etherum, Microbitcoin)
        For example:- https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/ https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/microbitcoin/
