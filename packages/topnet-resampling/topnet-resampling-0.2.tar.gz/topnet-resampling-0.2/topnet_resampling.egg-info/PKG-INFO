        -------------------------------------
        
        - Python Requirements: xarray netcdf4
        - Other Requirements: ncatted needs to be avialable (part of NCO)
        
        Resampling of streamq files
        -------------------------------------
        
        resample_streamq.py resamples a streamq file to daily, monthly or weekly time step.
        
        - prerequisite: run the fix_streamq.sh script on the streamq file. This will remove the time:bounds attribute on the target netcdf file.
        - It can also have an start and end date.
        
        Example:
        
        ``resample_streamq streamq.nc {1D,1M,W} [-start_date "mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss" -end_date "mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss"  --variables [list of variables to resample]``
        
        Currently we have the following available variables to resample:
        
        - Resample by sum: aprecip, drainge, soilevp, potevap, canevap, snowevp
        - Resample by averaging: river_flow_rate_mod
        
        Resampling of tseries files
        -------------------------------------
        
        resample_tseries.py in the same way as the streamq files. Usage is the same.
        
        Currently we have the following available variables to resample:
        
        - Resample by sum: aprecip, drainge, soilevp, potevap, canevap, snowevp, lakeprec, lakevap
        - Resample by averaging: mod_streamq, lakeqin, lakeqout, lakevol, lakarea, lakedepth.
        
        Streamq statistics
        -------------------------------------
        
        Use the script ``streamq_statistics`` to this. Groupings available: month, season and day.
