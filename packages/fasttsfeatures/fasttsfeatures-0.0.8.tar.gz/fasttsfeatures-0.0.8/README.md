# FastTSFeatures
> Time-series feature extraction as a service.
FastTSFeatures is an SDK to compute static, temporal and calendar variables as a service.

The package serves as a wrapper for [tsfresh](https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh), [tsfeatures](https://github.com/Nixtla/tsfeatures) and [holidays](https://github.com/dr-prodigy/python-holidays). Since we take care of the whole infrastructure, feature extraction becomes as easy as running a line in your python nootebooks or calling an API.

## Why?

We build FastTSFeatures because we wanted an easy and fast way to extract Time Series Features without having to think about infrastructure and deployment. Now we want to see if other Data Scientists find it useful too.

## Available Features (More than 600)

- 40+ Features: https://github.com/Nixtla/tsfeatures
- 600+ Temporal Features: https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh/
- 10 Temporal Features (lags, mean lags, std_lags) [Currently just supported for daily data]
Calendar Features (distance in minutes to holidays)
- Calendar features for 83 Countries https://github.com/dr-prodigy/python-holidays

## API
For API documentation  visit [PENDING]


## Install

`pip install fasttsfeatures`

## How to use
You can use FastTSFeatures by either using a completely public S3 bucket or by uploading a file to your own S3 bucket provided by us.  

### Data Format
Currently we only support `.csv` files. These files must include at least 3 columns, with a unique_id (identifier of each time-series) a date stamp and a value.

### 1. Request free trial

Request a free trial sending an email to: fede.garza.ramirez@gmail.com and get your `API_KEY`, `API_ID` and private `URI`.


### 2. Run `fasttsfeatures` on a private S3 Bucket

If you donÂ´t want other people to potentially have access to your data you can run `fasttsfeatures` on a private S3 Bucket. For that you have to upload your data to a private S3 Bucket that we will provide for you; you can do this inside of python.

#### 2.1 Upload to S3 from python

You will need the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` that we provided.


- Import and Instantiate `TSFeatures` introducing your `API_ID` and `API_KEY`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

```python
from fasttsfeatures.core import TSFeatures

tsfeatures = TSFeatures(api_id='<API_ID>',
                        api_key='<API_KEY>',
                        aws_access_key_id='<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>'],
                        aws_secret_access_key='<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>')
```

- Upload your local file introducing its name and the bucket's name (provided by `Nixtla` in the file we sent by email).

```python
s3_uri = tsfeatures.upload_to_s3(file='<YOUR FILE NAME>',
                                 bucketname='<PROVIDED BUCKET NAME>')
```

- Run the features extraction process

You can run temporal, static or calendar features on the data you uploaded.
To run the process specify:
- `s3_uri`: S3 uri provided after calling `tsfeatures.upload_to_s3()`.
- `freq`: Integer where  
  > {'Hourly': 24, 'Daily': 7, 'Monthly': 12, 'Quarterly': 4, 'Weekly': 1, 'Yearly': 1}.
- `ds_column`: Name of the unique id column.
- `y_column`: Name of the target column.

In the case of calendar variable you have to specify the country using the [ISO](https://pypi.org/project/holidays/) code.

```python

#Run Temporal Features
response_tmp_ft = tsfeatures.calculate_temporal_features_from_s3_uri(
                    s3_uri="<PRIVATE S3 URI HERE>",
                    freq=7, # For the moment only works for Daily data.
                    unique_id_column="<NAME OF ID COLUMN>",
                    ds_column= "<NAME OF DATESTAMP COLUMN>",
                    y_column="<NAME OF TARGET COLUMN>"
                  )

#Run Static Features
response_static_ft = tsfeatures.calculate_static_features_from_s3_uri(
                      s3_uri=s3_uri,
                      freq=7,
                      unique_id_column="<NAME OF ID COLUMN>",
                      ds_column= "<NAME OF DATESTAMP COLUMN>",
                      y_column="<NAME OF TARGET COLUMN>"
                    )

#Run Calendar Features
response_cal_ft = tsfeatures.calculate_calendar_features_from_s3_uri(
                    s3_uri=s3_uri,
                    country="<ISO>",
                    unique_id_column="<NAME OF ID COLUMN>",
                    ds_column= "<NAME OF DATESTAMP COLUMN>",
                    y_column="<NAME OF TARGET COLUMN>"
                  )
```

```python
response_tmp_ft
```


|    |   status | body                                          | id_job                               | message                                           |
|---:|---------:|:----------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
|  0 |      200 | "s3://nixtla-user-test/features/features.csv" | f7bdb6dc-dcdb-4d87-87e8-b5428e4c98db | Check job status at GET /tsfeatures/jobs/{job_id} |


- Monitor the process with the following code. Once it's done, access to your bucket to download the generated features.

```python
job_id = response_tmp_ft['id_job'].item()
```

```python
tsfeatures.get_status(job_id)
```


<div>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>status</th>
      <th>processing_time_seconds</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>InProgress</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

#### 2.2 Download your results from s3

Once the process is done you can download the results from s3.

```python
s3_uri_results = response_tmp_ft['body'].item()
tsfeatures.download_from_s3(s3_url=s3_uri_results)
```

<!-- #### 3.2 Case 2: Upload to S3 Manually using the S3 Console


##### A. Upload your dataset

- Access the url provided by `Nixtla`. You'll see a login page like the following. Just enter your user and paswsword.

##### B. Run the process



- Import the library.

```python
from fasttsfeatures.core import TSFeatures
```

- Instantiate `TSFeatures` introduce your `api_id` and `api_key`.

```python
tsfeatures = TSFeatures(api_id=os.environ['API_ID'],
                        api_key=os.environ['API_KEY'])
```

- Run the process introducing the public S3 uri.

```python

#Run Temporal Features
response_tmp_ft = tsfeatures.calculate_temporal_features_from_s3_uri(s3_uri="PUBLIC S3 URI HERE",
                                                     freq=7))

#Run Static Features
response_static_ft = tsfeatures.calculate_static_features_from_s3_uri(s3_uri="PUBLIC S3 URI HERE", freq=7)

#Run Calendar Features
response_cal_ft = tsfeatures.calculate_calendar_features_from_s3_uri(s3_uri="PUBLIC S3 URI HERE",
                                                     country="USA")
```

```python
display_df(response)
```


|    |   status | body                                               | id                                   | message                                           |

      <th>0</th>
      <td>InProgress</td>
      <td>20</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

Once the process is done you will find a file for each process you ran in the URI we provied. -->

<!-- ### 3. Run fasttsfeatures on a public S3 Bucket (Reading and writing permissions needed)

- Import and Instantiate `TSFeatures`.  Introduce your `API_ID` and `API_KEY`.

```python
from fasttsfeatures.core import TSFeatures

tsfeatures = TSFeatures(api_id=os.environ['API_ID'],
                        api_key=os.environ['API_KEY'])
```

- Run the process introducing the public S3 uri.

```python

#Run Temporal Features
response_tmp_ft = tsfeatures.calculate_temporal_features_from_s3_uri(s3_uri="PUBLIC S3 URI HERE",
                                                     freq=7))

#Run Static Features
response_static_ft = tsfeatures.calculate_static_features_from_s3_uri(s3_uri="PUBLIC S3 URI HERE", freq=7)

#Run Calendar Features
response_cal_ft = tsfeatures.calculate_calendar_features_from_s3_uri(s3_uri="PUBLIC S3 URI HERE",
                                                     country="USA")
```

To see the status of your job you can run the following code

```python
response_tmp_ft
```


|    |   status | body                                          | id_job                               | message                                           |
|---:|---------:|:----------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
|  0 |      200 | "s3://nixtla-user-test/features/features.csv" | f7bdb6dc-dcdb-4d87-87e8-b5428e4c98db | Check job status at GET /tsfeatures/jobs/{job_id} |



- Monitor the process with the following code. Once it's done, access to your bucket to download the generated features.

```python
job_id = response['id_job'].item()
```

```python
display(tsfeatures.get_status(job_id))
```


<div>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>InProgress</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

Once the process is done you will find a file for each process you ran in the URI we provied. -->
