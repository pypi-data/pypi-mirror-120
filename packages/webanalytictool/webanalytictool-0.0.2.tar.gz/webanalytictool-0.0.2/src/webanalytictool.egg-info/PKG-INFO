Description: # WEBPAGE ANALYSIS TOOL
        
        This tool extracts insight from a webpage. The insights that can be extracted are:
        - all unique tags used in the document.
        - the most commonly used tag.
        - the longest path starting from root node to the descendent.
        - the longest path starting from root node where the most popular tag is used the most times.
