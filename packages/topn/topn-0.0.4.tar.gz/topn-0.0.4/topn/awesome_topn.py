    """
    r, c, and d are 1D numpy arrays all of the same length N. 
    This function will return arrays rn, cn, and dn of length n <= N such
    that the set of triples {(rn[i], cn[i], dn[i]) : 0 < i < n} is a subset of 
    {(r[j], c[j], d[j]) : 0 < j < N} and that for every distinct value 
    x = rn[i], dn[i] is among the first ntop existing largest d[j]'s whose 
    r[j] = x.

    Input:
        r and c: two 1D integer arrays of the same length
        d: 1D array of single or double precision floating point type of the
        same length as r or c
        ntop maximum number of maximum d's returned
        n_rows: an int. If > -1 it will replace output rn with Rn the
            index pointer array for the compressed sparse row (CSR) matrix
            whose elements are {C[rn[i], cn[i]] = dn: 0 < i < n}.  This matrix
            will have its number of rows = n_rows.  Thus the length of Rn is
            n_rows + 1
        n_jobs: number of threads, must be >= 1

    Output:
        (rn, cn, dn) where rn, cn, dn are all arrays as described above, or
        (Rn, cn, dn) where Rn is described above
