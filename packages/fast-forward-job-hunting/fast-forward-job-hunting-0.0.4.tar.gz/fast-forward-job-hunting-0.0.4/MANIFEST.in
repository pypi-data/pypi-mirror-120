#The patterns here are glob-style patterns: * matches zero or more regular filename characters (on #Unix, everything except forward slash; on Windows, everything except backslash and colon); ? #matches #a single regular filename character, and [chars] matches any one of the characters between #the #square brackets (which may contain character ranges, e.g., [a-z] or [a-fA-F0-9]). Setuptools #also #has undocumented support for ** matching zero or more characters including forward slash, #backslash, #and colon.

#Directory patterns are relative to the root of the project directory; e.g., graft example* will #include a directory named examples in the project root but will not include docs/examples/.

#File & directory names in MANIFEST.in should be /-separated; setuptools will automatically convert #the slashes to the local platformâ€™s appropriate directory separator.

#Commands are processed in the order they appear in the MANIFEST.in file. For example, given the #commands:

#graft tests
#global-exclude *.py[cod]
#the contents of the directory tree tests will first be added to the sdist, and then after that all #files in the sdist with a .pyc, .pyo, or .pyd extension will be removed from the sdist. If the #commands were in the opposite order, then *.pyc files etc. would be only be removed from what was #already in the sdist before adding tests, and if tests happened to contain any *.pyc files, they #would end up included in the sdist because the exclusion happened before they were included.
