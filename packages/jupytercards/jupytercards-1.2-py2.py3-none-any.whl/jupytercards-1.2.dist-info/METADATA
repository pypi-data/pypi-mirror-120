# JupyterCards
JupyterCards is a tool for displaying **interactive flash cards in Jupyter notebooks and Jupyter Book**.

The flash cards can be loaded from a Python list of dicts, a JSON local file, or via a URL to a JSON file.
The JSON file should contain a single JSON array of JSON objects. Each JSON object should have a "front"
key and a "back" key, and each value should be the string to display on the corresponding side of the 
flashcard. 

JupyterCards is available via pip:

``` pip install jupytercards```

Although using JSON objects for each flashcard is overkill, this model was
chosen to support future extensions to this library.
