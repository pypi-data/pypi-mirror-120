# JupyterCards
JupyterCards is a tool for displaying **interactive flash cards in Jupyter notebooks and Jupyter Book**.

The flash cards can be loaded from a Python list of dicts, a JSON local file, or via a URL to a JSON file.
The JSON file should contain a single JSON array of JSON objects. Each JSON object should have a "front"
key and a "back" key, and each value should be the string to display on the corresponding side of the 
flashcard. 

JupyterCards is available via pip:

``` pip install jupytercards```

Although using JSON objects for each flashcard is overkill, this model was
chosen to support future extensions to this library.

## Example of generating flashcard files from JupyterBook notebooks

In my Jupyter notebooks that are used as input to JupyterBook, I use panels with
the heading "DEFINITION" to call out definitions in the text. I have provided a
helper program `extractdefinitions.py` that I use to scan files for the
DEFINITION header and extract the appropriate lines that follow. The resulting
terms and definitions are dumped to corresponding JSON files in a "flashcards"
directory. An additional JSON file is generated for the whole chapter.
`extractdefinitions.py` takes 2 arguments: the directory to parse and the
chapter number to use to label the overall JSON definitions file. **This program
is very specific to my workflow and I am offering it only as reference in case
it can help someone else with a similar situation.**
