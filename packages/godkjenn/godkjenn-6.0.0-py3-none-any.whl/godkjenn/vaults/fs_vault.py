    """File-system implementation of a vault.

    This creates a directory for each test-id, and this directory can have either or both of a 'received' and 'accepted'
    directory containing the actual artifacts.

    This assumes it has complete control over the files under `root_directory`. You should not modify or delete files under
    `root_directory` (unless you really know what you're doing), and you should not add files or directories there either.

    The directory structure for the vault looks like this::

        <root>/
            test-id-1/
                test-metadata.json
                accepted/
                    metadata.json

                    metadata.json
                    data
            test-id-2/
                . . .

    Note that the test-id directories may not have the same name as the test-id they represent. Some test-ids
    contain characters which are not allowed in paths, so we have an algorithm that translates them into something
    acceptable.
