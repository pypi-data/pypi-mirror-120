        # `confusion-test` - Test Package for Dependency Confusion Vulnerability
        
        ## Background
        
        Since you found this package, you might have already read about the so-called
        dependency confusion vulnerability. If you have no idea what I am talking
        about, first read
        [this](https://medium.com/@alex.birsan/dependency-confusion-4a5d60fec610).
        
        The pip team is still discussing if this could and/or should be fixed within
        pip itself or whether this is somebody else's problem.
        
        Whatever the outcome of this discussion might be, you might want to mitigate
        this vulnerability *now*. Two tools (basically proxies which filter/route
        requests to repositories) have been proposed:
        
        * [devpi](https://www.devpi.net/)
        * [simpleindex](https://github.com/uranusjr/simpleindex)
        
        
        ## What's the use of `confusion-test`?
        
        Whatever you use as a mitigation, you might wonder if it actually works, i.e.,
        if you have package A in you private repository and someone else uploads
        package A to PyPI using a higher version number, will you actually *not*
        install the package from PyPI.
        
        You can use `confusion-test` for testing your mitigation. It is tiny and does
        not have any dependencies (as version 1.x) or functionality.
        
        
        ## How to use it
        
        1. Manually download the latest 1.x version of `confusion-test` from
           [PyPI](https://test.pypi.org/simple/confusion-test/). _Do not download
           a 666.x version!_
        
        2. Upload this file to your private repository. Here is how you would do it
           with [twine](https://pypi.org/project/twine/):
           ```
           twine upload -r YOUR_PRIVATE_REPO confusion-test-1.*.tar.gz
           ```
        
        3. Include `confusion-test` in your dependencies *without a version*.
        
        When you now install your dependencies, pip will try to install
        `confusion-test` with the highest version it can find:
        
        * If pip installs version 1.x from you local repository, all is fine.
        
        * If pip installs version 666.x from PyPI, the parent process (most likely
          pip) is being killed which should bring the installation process and your
          build pipeline to a grinding halt.
