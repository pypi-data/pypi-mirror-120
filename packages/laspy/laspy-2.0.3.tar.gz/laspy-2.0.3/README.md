# Laspy

Laspy is a python library for reading, modifying and creating LAS LiDAR
files.

Laspy is compatible with Python  3.6+.


Examples
--------

Directly read and write las
```Python
import laspy

las = laspy.read('filename.las')
las.points = las.points[las.classification == 2]
las.write('ground.laz')
```


Open data to inspect header (opening only reads the header and vlrs)

```Python
import laspy

with laspy.open('filename.las') as f:
    print(f"Point format:       {f.header.point_format}")
    print(f"Number of points:   {f.header.point_count}")
    print(f"Number of vlrs:     {len(f.header.vlrs)}")
```
Use the 'chunked' reading & writing features

```Python
import laspy

with laspy.open('big.laz') as input_las:
    with laspy.open('ground.laz', mode="w", header=input_las.header) as ground_las:
        for points in input_las.chunk_iterator(2_000_000):
            ground_las.write_points(points[points.classification == 2])

```

Appending points to existing file

```Python
import laspy

with laspy.open('big.laz') as input_las:
    with laspy.open('ground.laz', mode="a") as ground_las:
        for points in input_las.chunk_iterator(2_000_000):
            ground_las.append_points(points[points.classification == 2])
```

## Installation

Laspy can be installed either with `pip`:

```
pip install laspy # without LAZ support
# Or
pip install laspy[laszip] # with LAZ support via LASzip
# Or
pip install laspy[lazrs] # with LAZ support via lazrs
```

## Changelog

### Version 2.0.3

- Fix function that parses geotiff VLRs
- Fix handling of points with 'unregistered' extra bytes (PR #158)
- Fix to handle empty LAS/LAZ more robustly

### Version 2.0.2

- Fix system_identifier reading by ignoring non ascii characters instead of erroring ,(issue #148, PR #149).
- Fix `LasData.change_scaling` method.
- Update minimum lazrs version which allows to:
  - Fix Appending in LAZ files.
  - Improve memory usage when reading/writing. (issue #152)

### Version 2.0.1

- Fix `.min` `.max` methods of array views
- Ship the tests as part of the source distribution (But they won't be installed with `pip install`)

### Version 2.0.0

- Overhaul of the internals by essentially incorporating pylas into laspy,
  while the API to retrieve and set dimensions stayed the same, other parts changed
  and will require adaptation.
- Better LAZ support
  * Added support for writing LAZ
  * Changed decompression mechanism by using either `laszip` python bindings (and not laszip-cli)
  or `lazrs`
- Added ability to read and write LAS/LAS in `stream` / `chunked` mode.
- Changed laspy to support the reading and writing of LAS/LAZ data from and to `file-objects` and `bytes`
- Dropped support for python2.7, python3.6+ is supported.

### Version 1.7.0

- Fixed bug in point record format 5, 9 and 10 [#105](https://github.com/laspy/laspy/issues/105)
- Return explicit msg if laszip executable was not found [#110](https://github.com/laspy/laspy/issues/110)
- Supprt numpy 1.17 [#122](https://github.com/laspy/laspy/issues/122)

### Version 1.6.0

- Bug fix  [#92](https://github.com/laspy/laspy/issues/92)
- Test creation of all valid custom dimension data types
- Modify handling of extra bytes to be char data instead of numeric byte data

### Version 1.5.1

- Bug fixes [#67](https://github.com/laspy/laspy/pull/67), [#75](https://github.com/laspy/laspy/pull/75), [b02b40900b5](https://github.com/laspy/laspy/commit/b02b40900b5620972930cd0c201b4db1a6a69754)
- Allow usage of `laszip-cli` when working with LAZ files [#77](https://github.com/laspy/laspy/pull/77)

### Version 1.5.0

- Improved memory handling in base.FileManager [#48](https://github.com/laspy/laspy/pull/48)
- Introduced `r-` file mode, that only reads the header of as LAS file [#48](https://github.com/laspy/laspy/pull/48)
- LAS v. 1.4 bug fixes [#55](https://github.com/laspy/laspy/pull/55)
- Python 3 support [#62](https://github.com/laspy/laspy/pull/62)
