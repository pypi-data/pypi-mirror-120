# **Usage**

## Bypass **reCaptchaV3**


To bypass recaptcha v3, first you must find anchor URL.
- Open inspect-element on your browser.
- Go to the web page that has reCaptcha V3 (not V2 invisible).
- In Network tab you should see many requests.
- Type `anchor` in text-field filter to hide unnecessary requests.
- Now you should see a url like this:

  >```https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LfCVLAUAAAAFwwRnnCFW_J39&co=aHR....```

  pass this url to `reCaptchaV3` class:
 
Note that the anchor urls also can have `/enterprise/anchor` instead of `/api2/anchor` in other sites.

&nbsp;
```python
from pypasser import reCaptchaV3

reCaptcha_response = reCaptchaV3('ANCHOR URL')
## use this response in your request ...
```
Some good examples are [here](https://github.com/xHossein/PyPasser/tree/master/examples/reCaptchaV3).

&nbsp;
## **Proxy**

```python
from pypasser import reCaptchaV3
from pypasser.structs import Proxy

## Using Proxy structure
proxy = Proxy(Proxy.type.HTTPs,'HOST','PORT')

## with authentication credentials
# proxy = Proxy(Proxy.type.HTTPs,'HOST','PORT','USERNAME', 'PASSWORD')

reCaptcha_response = reCaptchaV3('ANCHOR URL', proxy)
```
_also you can configure it as Dict._


```python

proxy = {"http": "http://HOST:PORT",
         "https": "https://HOST:PORT"}

reCaptcha_response = reCaptchaV3(spotify_com, proxy)
```
&nbsp;
## **Timeout**
Default timeout is `20 seconds` but you can change the amount like this:

```python
from pypasser import reCaptchaV3

reCaptcha_response = reCaptchaV3('ANCHOR URL', timeout = 10)
```
