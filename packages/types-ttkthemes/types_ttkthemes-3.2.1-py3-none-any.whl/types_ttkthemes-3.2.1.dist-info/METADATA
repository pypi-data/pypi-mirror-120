## Typing stubs for ttkthemes

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `ttkthemes` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `ttkthemes`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/ttkthemes. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `75c75a093e9eb81c2b4b5cc77d2412692f0e4745`.
