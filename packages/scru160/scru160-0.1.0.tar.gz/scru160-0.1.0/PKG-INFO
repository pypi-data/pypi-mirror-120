# SCRU-160: Sortable, Clock and Random number-based Unique identifier

SCRU-160 ID is yet another attempt to supersede [UUID] in the use cases that
need decentralized, globally unique time-ordered identifiers. SCRU-160 is
inspired by [ULID] and [KSUID] and has the following features:

- 160-bit length
- Sortable by generation time (in binary and in text)
- Two case-insensitive encodings: 32-character base32hex and 40-character hex
- More than 32,768 unique, time-ordered but unpredictable IDs per millisecond
- Nearly 111-bit randomness for collision resistance

```python
from scru160 import scru160, scru160f

print(scru160())  # e.g. "05TVFQQ8UGDNKHDJ79AEGPHU7QP7996H"
print(scru160())  # e.g. "05TVFQQ8UGDNNVCCNUH0Q8JDD3IPHB8R"

print(scru160f())  # e.g. "017bf7eb48f41b7d6bd295bc5adc43436bc969df"
print(scru160f())  # e.g. "017bf7eb48f41b7e1bc98aec348dfa1539b41288"
```
