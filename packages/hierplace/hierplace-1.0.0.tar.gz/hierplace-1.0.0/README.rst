Hierarchical Placement Plugin
==================================

This PCBNEW plugin arranges the parts into groups that reflect the
hierarchy in the design.

-  Free software: MIT license

Features
--------

-  Creates an arrangement of the parts that reflects their level in the
   design hierarchy.
-  Will arrange only the parts that have been selected or, if no parts
   are selected, the entire design.
-  Will not move locked parts.

Installation
------------

On linux, just copy ``HierPlace.py`` to your local ``~/.kicad_plugins``
directory.

Usage
-----

There are two ways to use this plugin:

1. Press the ``Tools => External Plugins... => HierPlace`` button and
   all the unlocked parts will be arranged.

2. Select a subset of the parts and press the ``HierPlace`` button and
   only the unlocked parts in the selection will be arranged.

Example
~~~~~~~

Here is an example of an initial arrangement of parts in PCBNEW. The
SDRAM BGA and its seven decoupling capacitors are highlighted to show
how widely separated they are. Other sections of the circuitry are
similarly scattered.

The arrangement after running ``HierPlace`` is shown below. Now the
SDRAM and its decoupling capacitors are closely grouped, as are the
other sections of the circuitry.
