matADi is a simple Python module which acts as a wrapper on top of [casADi](https://web.casadi.org/) for easy definitions of hyperelastic strain energy functions. Gradients (stresses) and hessians (elasticity tensors) are carried out by casADi's powerful and fast **Automatic Differentiation (AD)** capabilities. It is designed to handle inputs with trailing axes which is especially useful for the application in Python-based finite element modules like [scikit-fem](https://scikit-fem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [FElupe](https://adtzlr.github.io/felupe/). Mixed-field formulations are supported as well as single-field formulations.

## Installation
Install `matADi` from PyPI via pip.

```shell
pip install matadi
```

## Usage
First, we have to define a symbolic variable on which our strain energy function will be based on.

**Note**: *A variable of matADi is an instance of a symbolic variable of casADi (`casadi.SX.sym`). All `matadi.math` functions are simple links to (symbolic) casADi-functions.*

```python
from matadi import Variable, Material
from matadi.math import det, transpose, trace

F = Variable("F", 3, 3)
```

Next, take your favorite paper on hyperelasticity or be creative and define your own strain energy density function as a function of some variables `x` (where `x` is always a **list** of variables).

```python
def neohooke(x, mu=1.0, bulk=200.0):
    """Strain energy density function of a nearly-incompressible 
    Neo-Hookean isotropic hyperelastic material formulation."""

    F = x[0]
    
    J = det(F)
    C = transpose(F) @ F
    I1_iso = J ** (-2 / 3) * trace(C)

    return mu * (I1_iso - 3) + bulk * (J - 1) ** 2 / 2
```

With this simple Python function we create an instance of a **Material**, which allows extra `args` and `kwargs` to be passed to our strain energy function. This instance now enables the evaluation of both **gradient** (stress) and **hessian** (elasticity) via methods based on automatic differentiation - optionally also on input data containing trailing axes.

```python
W = Material(
    x=[F],
    fun=neohooke,
    kwargs={"mu": 1.0, "bulk": 10.0},
)

# init some random deformation gradients
defgrad = np.random.rand(3, 3, 5, 100) - 0.5

for a in range(3):
    defgrad[a, a] += 1.0

P = W.gradient([defgrad])[0]
A = W.hessian([defgrad])[0]
```

## Hints
Please have a look at [casADi's documentation](https://web.casadi.org/). It is very powerful but unfortunately does not support all the Python stuff you would expect. For example Python's default if-statements can't be used in combination with a symbolic boolean operation. If you use `eigvals` to symbolically calculate eigenvalues and their corresponding gradients please call gradient and hessian methods with `W.gradient([defgrad], modify=True, eps=1e-5)` to avoid the gradient to be filled with NaN's. This is because the gradient of the implemented eigenvalue calculation is not defined for the case of repeated equal eigenvalues. The `modify` argument adds a small number `eps=1e-5` to the diagonal entries of the input data.
