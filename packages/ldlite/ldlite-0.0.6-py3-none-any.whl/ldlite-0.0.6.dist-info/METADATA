LDLite is a lightweight reporting tool for Okapi-based services.  It
is part of the Library Data Platform project and provides basic LDP
functions without requiring the platform to be installed.


Features
--------

* LDLite provides very lightweight LDP functions, with no
  infrastructure needed.  It requires only Python, and Okapi access to
  send CQL queries.

* Full SQL query support.  By default it uses an embedded DuckDB
  analytic database stored in a local file (no set up needed), and
  also supports PostgreSQL as an option.

* Easy installation: `pip install ldlite`

* Works with Jupyter Notebook and Python's data science ecosystem.

* Open source
