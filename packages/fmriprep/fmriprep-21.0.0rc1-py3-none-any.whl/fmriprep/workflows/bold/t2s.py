    Combine multiple echos of :abbr:`ME-EPI (multi-echo echo-planar imaging)`.

    This workflow wraps the `tedana`_ `T2* workflow`_ to optimally
    combine multiple echos and derive a T2* map.
    The following steps are performed:

    #. :abbr:`HMC (head motion correction)` on individual echo files.
    #. Compute the T2* map
    #. Create an optimally combined ME-EPI time series

    Parameters
    ----------
    echo_times : :obj:`list` or :obj:`tuple`
        list of TEs associated with each echo
    mem_gb : :obj:`float`
        Size of BOLD file in GB
    omp_nthreads : :obj:`int`
        Maximum number of threads an individual process may use
    name : :obj:`str`
        Name of workflow (default: ``bold_t2s_wf``)

    Inputs
    ------
    bold_file
        list of individual echo files
    bold_mask
        a binary mask to apply to the BOLD files

    Outputs
    -------
    bold
        the optimally combined time series for all supplied echos

A T2\\* map was estimated from the preprocessed BOLD by fitting to a monoexponential signal
decay model with nonlinear regression, using T2\\*/S0 estimates from a log-linear
regression fit as initial values.
For each voxel, the maximal number of echoes with reliable signal in that voxel were
used to fit the model.
The calculated T2\\* map was then used to optimally combine preprocessed BOLD across
echoes following the method described in [@posse_t2s].
The optimally combined time series was carried forward as the *preprocessed BOLD*.
