Description: # IDEA - Integrated Dashboard for Energy transition Analysis 
        _An open-access integrated visualization dashboard for the energy system models_
        
        
        ## Overview
        
        The repository contains a visualization toolkit to report results from five energy system models developed by Sustainable Energy Systems Group - [SESIT](https://sesit.cive.uvic.ca/) team, [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/).
        
        1. MESSAGEix-Canada - Integrated Assessment Model for Canada built on [MESSAGEix](https://docs.messageix.org/en/stable/)
        2. COPPER (Canadian Opportunities for Planning and Production of Electricity Resources) - Capacity expansion model
        3. [SILVER](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360544217312021) - Electricity system operation model
        3. SESIT's transportation modelling tool 
        5. SESIT's buildings modelling tool
        
        ## Usage
        
        Two standard data templates have been used to report results from the models. The details can be seen in the documentation. IDEA is developed using [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/) Python package.
