Description: # imglyb-bdv
        
        `imglyb-bdv` extends [imglyb](https://github.com/imglib/imglyb) with convenience
        methods and structures from [BigDataViewer](https://github.com/bigdataviewer/bigdataviewer-core)
        
        If you are interested in using `imglyb-bdv`, have a look at the `examples` folder
        and extend the examples as needed!
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        `imglyb-bdv` has been tested on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
        
        The following tools are required:
        
         * Python 3
         * Java 8 or 11 JDK (JRE is not enough)
         * [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
        
        If you use [conda](https://conda.io/), these will be installed for you.
        
        ### Installing with conda
        
        ```shell
        conda install -c conda-forge imglyb-bdv
        ```
        
        ### Installing with pip
        
        First, install the prerequisites above. Then run:
        
        ```shell
        pip install imglyb-bdv
        ```
        
        It is recommended to do this from inside a virtualenv or conda environment,
        rather than system-wide.
        
        ### Installing from source
        
        First, install the prerequisites above. Then run:
        
        ```shell
        git clone git://github.com/imglib/imglyb-bdv
        cd imglyb-bdv
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        It is recommended to do this from inside a virtualenv or conda environment,
        rather than system-wide.
        
        ## Usage
        
        It is suggested to follow and extend the examples in the `examples` folder
        according to your needs. Note that the examples have additional dependencies
        (`hdf5` and/or `dask`).
