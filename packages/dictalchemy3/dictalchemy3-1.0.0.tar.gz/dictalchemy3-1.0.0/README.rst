dictalchemy3
============

|Test|

``dictalchemy3`` adds asdict() and fromdict() methods to SQLAlchemy declarative models.

``dictalchemy`` was written by Daniel Holmstrom with contributions from Rob Hardwick and Mike Klimin.

``dictalchemy3`` is just a fork of the original project to make the code more modern (remove Python 2 support) and compatible to latest SQLAlchemy and setuptools versions. The API and functionality remain completely unchanged, so that it is a drop in replacement for the original ``dictalchemy``.
