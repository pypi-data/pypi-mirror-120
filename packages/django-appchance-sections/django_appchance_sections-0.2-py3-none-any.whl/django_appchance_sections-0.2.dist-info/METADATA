Appchance Sections
==================

This application will allow you to implement flexible sections. It is not an out of the box mechanism and its
implementation requires a bit of effort, but in return you get a solution that you can relatively easily adapt
to your needs.

Including: 
 - the possibility of generic and dynamic content,
 - convenient operation in the admin panel.

This solution was designed for the Django Rest Framework.


Not so quick start
------------------

The application `appchance_sections` contains only abstract models so you nead add new application

```
    python manage.py startapp mysections
```

add created app to settings.INSTALLED_APPS

```
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'mysections',
    ]
```

and define real models.


### 1. Real Section Model

In mysections.models.py file define `Section` model. If you need you can add additional fields, but the default fields
provide basic functionality.

```
    from appchance_sections.models import SectionAbstract
    from django.db import models
    
    class Section(SectionAbstract):
        pass
```

In your Django project settings file define `Section` model.

```
SECTION_MODEL = "mysections.Section"
```

In mysections.admin.py use `SectionAdminMixin` **which binds - most importantly - the modified form**.

```
    from appchance_sections.admin import SectionAdminMixin
    from django.contrib import admin
    from mysections.models import Section

    @admin.register(Section)
    class SectionAdmin(SectionAdminMixin):
        pass
```

In mysections.apps.py **it is very important that you do not forget to import `appchance_sections.receivers`
in the config**

```
    from django.apps import AppConfig
    
    class SectionsConfig(AppConfig):
        name = "mysections"
    
        def ready(self):
            from appchance_sections import receivers  # noqa F405
```

The last thing you have to do is add urls to urls.py

```
    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.urls import include, path
    
    urlpatterns = [
        path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
        path("", include("appchance_sections.urls", namespace="sections")),
    ]
```

### 2. Bind content

Then we need some content that we could present in sections. We can add two types of content:
 - dynamic
 - generic

At the beginning, I will show you how to define dynamic content and how to make this content possible to attach to
the section.


#### 2.1. Dynamic Content

For example, we want to create a banner application and present banners as a section.

Create new banners app - for example mybanners `python manage.py startapp mybanners`.

In *mybanners.models.py* file

```
    from appchance_sections.models import DynamicContentAbstract
    from django.db import models
    

    # This is standard model - nothing special
    class Banner(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
        image = models.ImageFile(upload_to="/uploads")
        url = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    
        def __str__(self):
            return self.name
    
    
    class BannerSection(DynamicContentAbstract):
        URL = "mybanners:bannersection-detail"
        WIDGETS = ["banner_slider", "banner_carousel"]
        PLACEHOLDERS = ["home_top", "between_products"]
        PREFIX = "banners"
    
    
    class BannerInSection(models.Model):
        banner_section = models.ForeignKey(BannerSection, related_name="banners", on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        banner = models.ForeignKey(Banner, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        order = models.PositiveSmallIntegerField(default=0)
    
        def __str__(self):
            return f"{self.banner_section.name} {self.banner.name}"
```

**Note**:
 - The `BannerSection.URL` should be a valid url, so you will have to add ViewSet and link it to urls.py
 - The `BannerSection.QUERY_PARAMS` allows you to add additional fixed query params to the url
 - The `BannerSection.PREFIX` is not required but useful because it is visible when adding content to a section
    in the Admin Panel
 - The `BannerSection.WIDGETS` and `BannerSection.PLACEHOLDERS` - list of widgets and section presentation places
    supported by the consument API
 - The `BannerSection.FILTER_ATTRIBUTE` - If you implement a custom filter that will allow you to filter 
    the list of banners assigned to a given section, this is where you enter the name of the query string parameter
    that is used to pass the section ID

You need `BannerSerializer` at first. It depends on your model. In this example it could look like this.

In *mybanners.serializer.py*

```
    from mybanners.models import Banner
    from rest_framework.serializers import ModelSerializer
    
    
    class BannerSerializer(ModelSerializer):
        class Meta:
            model = Banner
            fields = ["id", "name", "image", "url"]
```

In *mybanners.views.py*

```
    from mybanners.models import Banner, BannerSection
    from mybanners.serializers import BannerSerializer
    from rest_framework import mixins, viewsets
    
    from rest_framework.response import Response
    
    
    class BannerViewSet(viewsets.ReadOnlyModelViewSet):
        model = Banner
        permission_classes = (AllowAny,)
        queryset = Banner.objects.all()
        serializer_class = BannerSerializer
    
    
    class BannerSectionViewSet(mixins.RetrieveModelMixin, viewsets.GenericViewSet):
    
        model = BannerSection
        queryset = BannerSection.objects.all()
        serializer_class = BannerSerializer
    
        def retrieve(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
            instance = self.get_object()
            serializer = self.get_serializer(instance.banners, many=True)
            return Response(serializer.data)
```

**Note that the `BannerSectionViewSet.list` returns a list of banners** because you get the `BannerSection`
data when you request a list of sections from sections endpoint.


**Note! Alternatively, you can implement views like this - filter list by section**

```
    import django_filters
    from mybanners.models import Banner
    from mybanners.serializers import BannerSerializer
    from rest_framework import viewsets
    
    
    class BannerListFilterSet(django_filters.FilterSet):
        # do not forget set BannerSection.FILTER_ATTRIBUTE = "section"
        section = django_filters.NumberFilter(method="get_by_section", field_name="section")
    
        class Meta:
            model = Banner
            fields = []
    
        def get_by_section(self, queryset, _field_name, value):
            return (
                queryset.filter(banners_in_section__banner__id=value).order_by("banners_in_section__order")
                if value else queryset
            )
    
    class BannerViewSet(viewsets.ReadOnlyModelViewSet):
        model = Banner
        permission_classes = (AllowAny,)
        queryset = Banner.objects.all()
        serializer_class = BannerSerializer
        filter_class = BannerListFilterSet
```

In *mybanners.urls.py*

```
    from mybanners.views import BannerSectionViewSet, BannerViewSet
    from rest_framework import routers
    
    router = routers.DefaultRouter()
    router.register(r"banners", BannerViewSet)
    router.register(r"banner-sections", BannerSectionViewSet)
    
    app_name = "banners"
    urlpatterns = router.urls
```

and


```
    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.urls import include, path
    
    urlpatterns = [
        path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
        path("", include("appchance_sections.urls", namespace="sections")),
        path("", include("mybanners.urls", namespace="banners")),
    ]
```

Now the `BannerSection` model needs to be registered also as dynamic content for the section.

In *mybanners.sections.py* file define a registration function.

```
    from appchance_sections.utils import register_dynamic_content
    from mybanners.models import BannerSection
    
    
    def register_section_contents():
        register_dynamic_content(content_class=BannerSection)
```

The `register_section_contents` function should be called when the banner application is ready

So call it in *mybanners.apps.py*

```
    from django.apps import AppConfig
    
    
    class BannersConfig(AppConfig):
        name = "mybanners"
    
        def ready(self):
            from mybanners.sections import register_section_contents
            register_section_contents()
```

#### 2.2 Generic Content

Sometimes you don't want to add items to a section manually. For example, you want to view a section with:

- news
- bestsellers calculated on the number of units sold in the last week
- products on promotion marked with the `is_promotion` flag, etc.

You can register such content using `register_section_content`

In *mysections.sections.py*

```
    from appchance_sections.utils import register_section_content
    
    
    def register_section_contents():
        
        placements = ["home_middle", "home_sidebar"]
        
        news_widgets = ["news_list"]
        register_section_content(
            slug="news",
            name="News",
            url="mynews:news-list",
            widgets=news_widgets,
            placements=placements
        )
    
        product_widgets = ["product_grid_3x3", "product_flat_list"]
    
        register_section_content(
            slug="bestsellers",
            name="Bestsellers",
            url="myproducts:product-list",
            query_params={"bestseller": "true"},
            widgets=product_widgets,
            placements=placements
        )
    
        register_section_content(
            slug="promoted_products",
            name="Promoted products",
            url="myproducts:product-list",
            query_params={"is_promotion": 1},
            widgets=product_widgets,
            placements=placements
        )
```

The `register_section_contents` function should be called on start app

For example you can call it in *mysections.apps.py*

```
    from django.apps import AppConfig
    
    class SectionsConfig(AppConfig):
        name = "mysections"
    
        def ready(self):
            from appchance_sections import receivers  # noqa F405
            from mysection.sections import register_section_contents
            register_section_contents()
```
