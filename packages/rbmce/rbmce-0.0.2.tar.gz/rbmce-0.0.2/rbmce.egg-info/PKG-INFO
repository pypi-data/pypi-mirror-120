### RBMCE (Rule-Based Microbiology Concept Extractor):
>This code was developed to provide an open-source python package to extract clinical concepts from free-text semi-structured microbiology reports. The two primary outputs for this package are (1) an binary estimation of patient bacterial infection status and (2) a list of all clinically relevant microorganisms found in the report. These outputs were validated on two independent datasets and achieved f-1 scores over 0.95 on both outputs when compared to expert review. Full details on background, algorithm, and validation results can be seen at our paper here: (currently being written, will update once submitted to archive).

### üè† [Homepage](https://github.com/geickelb/rbmce)
### ‚ú® [package](https://pypi.org/project/rbmce/)

## Requirements
```sh
* python >=3.6.8
* pandas >=0.25.0

```

## Install
```sh
pip install rbmce
```

## Usage

#### Recommended datastructure:


the rbcme.run() function expects a pandas dataframe with the following elements (associated column names can be specified as kwargs):

* parsed_note: 
    * microbiology report txt in either a raw or (**perferable) chopped up into components (eg gram stain/growth report/ab susceptability)
* culture_id: 
    * a primary key tied to a given sample/specimen + microbiological exam order. 
    * Often a microbiology order can be tied to numerous components (eg gram stain/growth report/ ab susceptability). additionally these can be appended to same report or added as a new report tied to same sample + order. all of these tied to a sample+order should share same culture_id
* visit_id:
    * primary key for patient's visit/encounter
    * can be 1-many:1 to culture_id or 1:1 (in which case can specify as culture_id)
    * in some datasets a patient may have multiple cultures performed in a visit/encounter. 

#### Inline:
```sh
import rbmce
import pandas as pd
d={'parsed_note': 'No Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Aeromonas or Plesiomonas isolated.', 'culture_id': 1, 'visit_id': 1}
df=pd.DataFrame(data=d, index=[1])
rbmce.run(df)

```
#### Command Line:
see rbcme_run_example.py for example of an executable python file to import, format, process w/ rbmce, and save outputs (annotated dataframe, markdown_summary file)


## Run tests
#### Inline 
```sh
from rbmce import debug
test_str='No Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Aeromonas or Plesiomonas isolated.'
debug.rbmce_str_in(test_str)

```
#### Command Line:
```sh
python -m rbmce.debug 'No Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Aeromonas or Plesiomonas isolated.'

```
