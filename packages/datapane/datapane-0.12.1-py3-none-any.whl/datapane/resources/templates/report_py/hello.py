## Introduction

Datapane is a Python library for building interactive reports from data components like pandas DataFrames, Altair/ Plotly/Matplotlib charts, and Markdown.

Reports can be exported as standalone HTML documents (this guide itself is a Datapane report ðŸ˜‰), or hosted on our platform, where they can be shared via a link or embedded in your application.

## Hello world

Let's start with a minimal example to understand the basic flow (feel free to copy-paste this code and follow along in your IDE or notebook).  Imagine you have an existing notebook where you've analysed and charted some data:
"""
    ),
    dp.Code(
        """
  import altair as alt
  from vega_datasets import data

  source = data.cars()

  plot1 = alt.Chart(source).mark_circle(size=60).encode(
      x='Horsepower',
      y='Miles_per_Gallon',
      color='Origin',
      tooltip=['Name', 'Origin', 'Horsepower', 'Miles_per_Gallon']
  ).interactive()
    """
    ),
    dp.Text(
        """
    To share this with someone non-technical, you'd typically send them a raw notebook file or put screenshots in a presentation. Instead, let's build an interactive report using Datapane - just add the following lines:
"""
    ),
    dp.Code(
        """
    import datapane as dp

  dp.Report(
    dp.Plot(plot1),
    dp.DataTable(source)
  ).save(path="Hello_world.html")
  """
    ),
    dp.Text(
        """
    After we import the library, we create a report object, wrap our chart in a Plot block, dataframe in a DataTable block, then save as a standalone HTML document. Now users can open this report in their browser and interact with these objects:
"""
    ),
    dp.Plot(plot1),
    dp.DataTable(source),
    dp.Text(
        """
    ## A more complex example

Datapane also has a lot of pre-built components for layout and interactivity, which can help you present more complex data. Let's explore some of these:
"""
    ),
    dp.Code(
        """
  import altair as alt
  from vega_datasets import data
  import datapane as dp

  source = data.cars()

      x='Horsepower',
      y='Miles_per_Gallon',
      color='Origin',
      tooltip=['Name', 'Origin', 'Horsepower', 'Miles_per_Gallon']
  ).interactive()

  dp.Report(
      dp.Formula("x^2 + y^2 = z^2"),
      dp.Group(
          dp.BigNumber(
              heading="Number of percentage points",
              value="84%",
              change="2%",
              is_upward_change=True
          ),
          dp.BigNumber(
              heading="Simple Statistic",
              value=100

      dp.Select(
          dp.Plot(plot1, label="Chart"),
          dp.DataTable(source, label="Data")
      ),
  ).save(path="Layout_example.html")"""

    The syntax is pretty similar, except Select and Group blocks allow you to nest other blocks inside. This is helpful when you need a non-linear or dashboard layout.

Running that code generates the following report: """

# Sharing Reports

## Datapane Community

In addition to saving documents locally, you can use [Datapane Community](https://datapane.com/explore) to host and share your reports.

- You can upload and share unlimited public reports (and limited private reports)
- Reports can be embedded in places like Medium, Notion, or your own website (see [here](https://docs.datapane.com/reports/embedding-reports-in-social-platforms))
- Viewers can explore and download your data with additional DataTable analysis features

To get started with a free API key, run the following command in your terminal:
```
datapane signup
```
Once you've completed signup, your API key will be stored in your environment (you can also see it in your [profile](https://datapane.com/settings/).

Now, just change `report.save` to `report.upload` and your report will be pushed to Datapane.com: """
    ),
    dp.Code(
        """
  # dp.Report(
  #   ...
  # ).save(path="Hello_world.html")

  dp.Report(
      ...
  ).upload(name="Hello world")"""
    ),
    dp.Text(
        """
  This will generate a report URL which you can send to someone else or paste into another platform for embedding.

## Datapane Teams

If you need private report sharing, [Datapane Teams](https://docs.datapane.com/datapane-teams/) allows secure sharing of reports and the ability to deploy your Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts as interactive apps.

- Share reports privately with your company or external clients
- Deploy Jupyter Notebooks and scripts as apps, with inputs that can be run by your team interactively to dynamically create results
- Schedule reports to automatically update

Datapane Teams is offered as both a managed SaaS service and an on-prem install. For more information, see [the documentation](https://docs.datapane.com/datapane-teams/tut-deploying-a-script). You can find pricing [here](https://datapane.com/pricing).
