# pyMDT (Messy Data Tools)
This Python package handles a variety of tasks I run into regularly in wrangling various messy data into useful states. This is all higher level logic dealing with specific kinds of data but built for things that I routinely need to do across various use cases. It focuses on things like connecting dots between various identifier systems in order to link data together and pull in other useful properties for analysis.

I'm not currently building this for others, but I am trying to do a reasonable job on organizing everything here for my own purposes. If you happen to find it useful and would like to collaborate, feel free to get in touch.
