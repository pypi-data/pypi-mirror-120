Description: # APRheology
        ##### _Toolkit for Anton Paar rheometer data_
        
        The purpose of this program is to facilitate the analysis 
        of rheometer data of polymeric samples. The program is originally
        designed to use RheoCompass csv exports as input, however, it is 
        developed without involvement of Anton Paar and is thus independent
        from the company and its RheoCompass software. 
        
        Currently, the extraction of relaxation times from frequency sweep
        and stress relaxation experiments is supported. Other functionality might 
        be added as needed.
