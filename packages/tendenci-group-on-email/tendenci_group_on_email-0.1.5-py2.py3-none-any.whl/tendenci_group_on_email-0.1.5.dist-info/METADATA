=======================
Tendenci Group on Email
=======================


Add automatic groups based on email suffix, eg. ".edu" for use with discounts and such.

* Free software: GNU General Public License v3

To install, add ``group_on_email`` to Django's ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.
Thereafter, members are added to and removed from the ".edu" group when their
profile is updated. The group can be entirely regenerated with the
``group_on_email`` management command.
