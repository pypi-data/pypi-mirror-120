Methods
=======

The :class:`AccountingParser` class has the following methods:

    * sge_parser_ - Method for parsing SGE (Sun Grid Engine) accounting files.

    * slurm_parser_ - Method for parsing SLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) accounting files

We focused on the two schedulers that we are/have used for at our schools super computer. we plan on adding more methods to parse other
schedulers/resource managers in the futur. The next few section will go into detail on how each method works with a closing heading comparing them.
