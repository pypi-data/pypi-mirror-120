# Welcome to the FangEngine!

This engine allows you to easily create object oriented, event-driven games in Python! You can customize as much or as little of the engine as you need to build your next great game!

To get started, simply run the following command in your terminal:
```
pip install FangEngine
```

Now that everything is installed, you can check out the [FangEngine Documentation](https://github.com/CPSuperstore/FangEngineDocs/blob/master/README.md) or the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/CPSuperstore/FangEngine/issues)

Thank you for using FangEngine, and good luck with your next project!

## Examples
You can view examples of games built in the engine over on [Itch.IO](https://cpsuperstore.itch.io/)

## Pricing
When your game starts making money, we ask that you leave us an 8% donation of whatever you make from using our engine. 

This helps to keep the website free, and development going.
