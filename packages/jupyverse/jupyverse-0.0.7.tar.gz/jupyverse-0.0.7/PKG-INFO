# jupyverse

A set of [FPS](https://github.com/adriendelsalle/fps) plugins implementing a Jupyter server.

WARNING: jupyverse is experimental and should not be used in place of
[jupyter-server](https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server), which is the official Jupyter server.

## Install

```bash
pip install jupyverse[jupyterlab]
```

Note: at this stage of development, it is preferable to install from sources (see below).

## Development install

Clone this repository and install the needed plugins:

```bash
pip install -e .[jupyterlab] --no-deps
pip install -e plugins/jupyterlab
pip install -e plugins/contents
pip install -e plugins/kernels
pip install -e plugins/terminals
pip install -e plugins/nbconvert
pip install -e plugins/yjs
pip install -e plugins/auth

# you should also install the latest FPS:
pip install git+https://github.com/adriendelsalle/fps

# if you want RetroLab instead of JupyterLab:
# pip install -e .[retrolab] --no-deps
# pip install -e plugins/retrolab
# ...
```

## Usage

## Without authentication

```bash
jupyverse --open-browser --authenticator.mode=noauth
```

This will open a browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000 by default, and load the JupyterLab front-end.
You have full access to the API, without restriction.

## With token authentication

```bash
jupyverse --open-browser --authenticator.mode=token
```

This is the default mode, and it corresponds to
[Jupyter Server's token-based authentication](https://jupyter-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operators/security.html#security-in-the-jupyter-server).

## With user authentication

```bash
jupyverse --open-browser --authenticator.mode=user
```

We provide a JupyterLab extension for authentication, that you can install with:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/davidbrochart/jupyverse-auth
```

You can currently authenticate as an anonymous user, or
[using a GitHub account](https://github.com/davidbrochart/jupyverse-auth#authentication-with-github).

## With collaborative editing

```bash
jupyverse --open-browser --JupyterLab.collaborative=true
```

This is especially interesting if you are "user-authenticated", since your will appear as the
identity you chose for authentication.
