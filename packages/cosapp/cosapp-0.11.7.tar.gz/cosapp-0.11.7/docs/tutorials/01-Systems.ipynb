    "\n",
    "- An *inward* is an input parameter needed by the system to compute its output. For example, the pressure losses coefficient of a duct is an inward, used to compute the output flow port from its input flow port.\n",
    "- An *outward* is an output variable deduced from inputs, such as an intermediate variable of a computation, which is exposed to other systems. For instance, the difference between the input and output pressures in a duct system is a local variable, which may be of interest to neighbouring systems. Another example is the table object read from a filename (the filename being usually a *inward*). \n",
    "\n",
    "An inward `x` defined in system `s` (resp. outward) can be accessed as either `s.x` or `s.inwards.x` (resp. `s.outwards.x`).\n",
    "\n",
    "All variables in **CoSApp** accept additional information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *unit*: Physical unit of the variable, given by a string. **CoSApp** will take care of unit conversion between connected systems. However, *units are not enforced* inside a `System`. Therefore, module developers must ensure that all variables are consistently converted in method `compute`.\n",
    "- *desc*: Short description of the variable.\n",
    "- *dtype*: If you need to force certain data type(s) on a variable, a tuple of acceptable types can be provided through this keyword. If that information is not supplied, dtype is inferred from the variable value; *e.g.* a number (`int` or `float`) will be typed as `Number`."
